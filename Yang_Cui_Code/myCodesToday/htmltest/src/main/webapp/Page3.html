	<h2>How Wings Generate Lift</h2>

	<p>Galileo’s Square-Cube Law plays its role in determining the maximum weight of flying objects. The larger, heavier flying animals or airplanes require a disproportionally greater amount of power to fly. So if there is a limitation on the amount of power available, then there is a limitation on the mass of the flying animal or airplane. For airplanes, the largest airplanes must use jet engines since to obtain flight these heavy airplanes requires the most powerful engines. Likewise, the largest flying animals today are birds because birds have evolved a hot blooded high metabolism that gives them the power needed for flight. Warm blooded flying mammals, or bats, are on the next notch down the power scale. The consequence of having a lower metabolism is that the largest flying bats are no more than one tenth the mass of the largest flying birds. Among vertebrates, cold blooded reptiles are on the lowest rung of the power scale. There are a few lizards and snakes that are called flying reptiles, yet in reality these cold blooded reptiles can hardly manage much beyond a forty five degree angled fall to the ground. Today there are no reptiles capable of generating the power needed to fly, and yet during the Mesozoic era reptiles grew to be the largest flying animals that ever existed. The largest of these pterosaurs was the Quetzalcoatlus. It had a chest size as large as a horse and stood as tall as a giraffe. How the Quetzalcoatlus and the rest of the pterosaurs flew would seem to be quite the scientific paradox, and yet some paleontologists continue to insist that there is no scientific paradox regarding how the pterosaurs could have flown.

The most damaging evidence refuting the position of these paleontologists is that they have never succeeded in getting a radio controlled model pterosaur to fly. Between 1984 and 1986 the Smithsonian gave $700,000 to the aerodynamics expert Paul MacCready for the purpose of creating a RC model demonstrating the flying ability of the Quetzalcoatlus northropi. MacCready’s team quickly realized that a full sized RC model constructed with a weight and power reasonable for this animal would not be capable of flight. So they opted for a half sized model, weighing only 44 lbs., power launched high into the air with a stabilizing tail, that could then hopefully descend gently back to the earth as it flapped its wings.</p>
