      <h3>BECUASE SIZE MATTERS</h3>
      <p>Does size matter? More specifically, can a rock, a person, a car, a planet, an airplane, or a dinosaur exist at any arbitrary size? 
      This is a fundamental scientific question, and yet for the most part the science community has sidestepped this simple question. 
      Galileo’s Square-Cube Law explains why size matters, and in fact Galileo’s Square-Cube Law is such a 
      fundamental scientific truth that science is hardly science without it.</p>

      <h3>COOLING IS MORE THAN SAYING</h3>
      <p>When preparing a banquet, a large turkey or ham is usually placed in the convection oven before the other food since these larger objects 
      have a low surface area to mass ratio thus requiring more time for the heat to penetrate through to the interior. In contrast to a Thanksgiving 
      turkey that requires 3-4 hours in the oven, a pizza has a large surface area to mass ratio and so it only needs about 14 minutes to cook..</p>

      <h3>MEAT DON'T FLY LIKT THAT</h3>        
      <p>Today there are no reptiles capable of generating the power needed to fly, and yet during the Mesozoic era reptiles grew to be the largest 
      flying animals that ever existed. The largest of these pterosaurs was the Quetzalcoatlus. It had a chest size as large as a horse and stood as 
      tall as a giraffe. How the Quetzalcoatlus and the rest of the pterosaurs flew would seem to be quite the scientific paradox, and yet some 
      paleontologists continue to insist that there is no scientific paradox regarding how the pterosaurs could have flown.</p>
