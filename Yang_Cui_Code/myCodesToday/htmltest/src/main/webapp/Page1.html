<h2>Explaining the Square-Cube Law</h2>

<p>When we are comparing the size of objects it is common to make a statement such as one object is twice as large as another object, without clarifying if the size comparison is based on length, area, or volume. Usually this sloppiness does not cause mistakes since we can infer from the objects being compared whether the comparison is based on a one dimensional, two dimensional, or three dimensional attribute. Yet an important fact that is often overlooked is that the length, area, and volume of similar shaped objects do not scale proportionally.

Of great importance is the ratio between area and volume or, assuming equal densities, the ratio between area and weight. Two similar shaped yet different size objects will have a different ratio of area to volume: the larger object will have a lower area to volume ratio than the smaller object. This seemingly subtle point is actually fundamental to all of science and so it needs to be emphasized: because the ratio between area and volume changes with size it is incorrect to believe that two similar yet proportionally different objects can ever be the same. Size matters.

We can use a simple cube that is scaled up to be ten times taller to illustrate how the area to volume ratio changes with size. As shown in figure 1, if each dimension of a solid cube is made ten times larger than its original model, its area touching the ground will be 10 x 10 or one hundred times larger. Meanwhile the volume will increase by 10 x 10 x 10 or a thousand times greater than the original. If the larger cube is made of the same material as the original cube, the mass and the weight of the larger cube will be a thousand times greater than the smaller one.

If our two cubes are made of the same material then they will have the same density, the density being the amount of mass per unit volume. Yet since the two cubes have different area to volume ratios they will likewise have different stress at the base of each cube. If too much stress is placed on an object then it will either break or collapse.</p>
