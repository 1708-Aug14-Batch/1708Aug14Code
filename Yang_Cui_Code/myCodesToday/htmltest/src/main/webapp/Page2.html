<h2>The Effect of the Surface Area to Volume Ratio</h2>

<p>Another important scaling property is the surface area to volume ratio. Again using the example of the cubes, the total surface area of the smaller cube is 6 L2 and its volume is L3. The surface area to volume ratio for the small cube is then 6 / L. Performing the same calculations with the larger cube produces a surface to volume ratio of 6 / (10 L). So that a comparison of the two ratios shows that the cube that is ten times larger has a surface to volume ratio that is one tenth of the smaller cube. From this we can draw the general conclusion that larger objects will have lower surface area to volume ratios than similar smaller objects.The surface area to mass ratio is important to the transfer to thermal energy: heat. Whenever there is a difference in temperatures, thermal energy travels from one location to the other through conduction, convection, or radiation.

Conduction is the transfer of heat through a solid material such as when one side of a metal object is heated the heat easily distributes itself throughout the entire object. Different materials conduct heat at vastly different rates. So we need to choose the appropriate material when the transfer or lost of heat is an issue. For example, previously metal aluminum window frames were preferred over wood frame windows because unlike wood the aluminum metal did not rot. However as people became more energy conscious they recognized that the metal framed windows had their own undesirable attribute in that they allowed the heat to easily moved between the inside and the outside of the home. Because of this vinyl windows that neither rot nor conduct heat are now the preferred window frames. Notice that the shape of the mouse is as close as it can be to that of a sphere, a shape that produces the minimum amount of surface area. Now notice that the elephant’s skin is covered with wrinkles thus increasing the elephant’s surface area. Also notice that the mouse is like nearly all mammals in being covered with a thick fur coat while the elephant is nearly void of all hair. The small mouse is trying to maintain heat while the large elephant is trying to lose it. </p>
