	 * Java allows us to write classes within other classes,
	 * these are called nested classes
	 * 
	 * Benefits:
	 * 	- logical grouping of classes only used in one place
	 * 	- increases encapsulation
	 *  - more readable and maintainable code
	 *  
	 * Types:
	 *  - static - declared as a static member of another class
