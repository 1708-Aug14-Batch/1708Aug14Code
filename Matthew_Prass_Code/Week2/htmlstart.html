<h2> What IS a design pattern? </h2>

    A design pattern is a <b>well-proved</b> solution for solving the specific problem/task.<br>

<h3> There are 3 different kinds of design patterns used in Java</h3>
<ol>
<li class = "h4">Creational</li>
<li class = "h4">Structural</li>
<li class = "h4">Behavioral</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Creational</h1>
<div class="card-body">
    Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class)
</div>
<ol class = "h4"> <u>Examples</u> <br>
<br>
<br>
<li>Singleton</li>
<img src="singleton.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h6>Singleton Pattern says that just"define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it".<br>

In other words, a class must ensure that only single instance should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.
</h6>
<li>Factory</li>
<img src="factorymethod.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h6>A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses <br>
decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.

The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.</h6>
<li>Abstract Factory</li>
<img src="abstractfactory.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h6>Abstract Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating families of related (or dependent) <br>
objects but without specifying their concrete sub-classes.That means Abstract Factory lets a class returns a factory of classes. <br>
So, this is the reason that Abstract Factory Pattern is one level higher than the Factory Pattern.<br>

An Abstract Factory Pattern is also known as Kit.</h6>
</ol>

<h1>Structural</h1>
<div class="card-body">
Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.<br>

The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.<br>

These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.
</div>
<ol class = "h4"> <u>Examples</u> <br>
<br>
<br>
<li>Bridge</li>
<img src="bridgeuml.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h6>A Bridge Pattern says that just "decouple the functional abstraction from the implementation so that the two can vary independently".<br>

The Bridge Pattern is also known as Handle or Body.

.</h6>
<li>Decorator</li>
<img src="decoratoruml.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h6>A Decorator Pattern says that just "attach a flexible additional responsibilities to an object dynamically".<br>

In other words, The Decorator Pattern uses composition instead of inheritance to extend the functionality of an object at runtime.<br>

The Decorator Pattern is also known as Wrapper.

.</h6>
<li>Facade</li>
<img src="facadeuml.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h6>A Facade Pattern says that just "just provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, <br>
therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client".<br>

In other words, Facade Pattern describes a higher-level interface that makes the sub-system easier to use.

Practically, every Abstract Factory is a type of Facade.</h6>
</ol>


<h1>Behavioral</h1>
<div class="card-body">
   Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.<br>

In these design patterns,the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.<br>

That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.
</div>
<ol class = "h4"> <u>Examples</u> <br>
<br>
<br>
<li>Command</li>
<img src="commanduml.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h6> Command Pattern says that "encapsulate a request under an object as a command and pass it to invoker object.<br> 
Invoker object looks for the appropriate object which can handle this command and pass the command to the <br>
corresponding object and that object executes the command".<br>

It is also known as Action or Transaction.</h6>
<li>Interpreter</li>
<img src="interpreteruml.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h6>An Interpreter Pattern says that "to define a representation of grammar of a given language, along with an <br>
interpreter that uses this representation to interpret sentences in the language".<br>

Basically the Interpreter pattern has limited area where it can be applied. We can discuss the Interpreter pattern only in terms of formal grammars but <br>
in this area there are better solutions that is why it is not frequently used.<br>

This pattern can applied for parsing the expressions defined in simple grammars and sometimes in simple rule engines.</h6>
<li>Iterator</li>
<img src="iteratoruml.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<h6>Iterator Pattern is used "to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying implementation".<br>

The Iterator pattern is also known as Cursor.<br>

In collection framework, we are now using Iterator that is preferred over Enumeration.</h6>
